# Scrabble Game

By Colin Butera, Jakob Mathieson, Diwas Dahal, Joseph Cancellieri


## Description
Implementation of the classic scrabble game. Users will be able to take turns and play against
an AI. Games will be savable to the cloud and users can create accounts to save their progress.

## Notes
The functionality is all there, there are some minor bugs.  Turns with the AI are stopped after 1
because the AI is still in development.  It has logic to make placements but cannot physically yet
place the tiles. main.py in the demo folder can be used to run the and test the game.
